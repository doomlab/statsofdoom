      <description>The Year of the Thesis!
Just wanted to highlight several publications from this year, which were mostly theses from some fabulous young researchers:
 Scofield, J.E., Kostic, B., &amp;amp; Buchanan, E.M. (2019). How the presence of others affects desirability judgments in heterosexual and homosexual participants. Archives of Sexual Behavior, X, XX–XX. doi: 10.1007/s10508-019-01516-w
 Maxwell, N.P. &amp;amp; Buchanan, E.M. (2019). Investigating the interaction of direct and indirect relation on memory judgments and retrieval.</description>

      <description>Just updated my CV - here&#39;s a few new publications and conferences! The weird thing about the automatic CV updater I wrote is that you can&#39;t really predict what order the same year publications are going to be in - not that it matters in general, but it&#39;s an interesting side effect.
Also, super proud - both of these are student theses turned papers:

      <description>I have happily acquired a new Mac Book (yay!) and a new work computer (Windows). So, I&#39;ve been making One Drive exceedingly unhappy moving GBs of file from one to another.
As I was working on reconnecting my GitHub repositories to the files, I was trying to understand why several of my repos were saying I had a bunch of file changes but nothing in the files themselves had changed. I noticed they were mostly .</description>

      <description>Heyo! Frederik, the author of papaja, requested that we update him with papers written with his package. I was like, oh man, like the whole lab?! So, I decided that I could probably make it easy by making a table here. Obviously, this table is current at the moment, as I hope many of the ones under review will get accepted, and I have several others that we will start writing soon.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I don&#39;t really feel like working too hard today, so I decided to write a blog post about how my student Will and I used rvest to mine articles from several different news sources for a project. All the scripts and current ongoings of this project can be found on our OSF page - this project is also connected to the GitHub folder with the files.
First, we picked four web sources to scrape - The New York Times, NPR, Fox News, and Breitbart because of their known political associations, and specifically, we focused on their political sections.</description>

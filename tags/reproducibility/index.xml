      <description>Many thanks to Rutgers University Spanish and Portuguese Department (https://span-port.rutgers.edu/) for asking me to come talk about multilevel models. I enjoyed talking to the group, meeting Twitter friends in real life!, and I am especially impressed by what their department is doing in what is often considered a qualitative science.
I used RStudio&amp;rsquo;s Cloud to share a workspace with all the materials, packages, and other information you might need. I built the slide show using markdown, so that people could watch the slides and/or take their own notes.</description>

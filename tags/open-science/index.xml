      <description>So! Here&amp;rsquo;s the plan we are working on to update everything with official details:
 JASP + OSKB:  The JASP pages on OSF are all updated: https://osf.io/t56kg/ I have built the structure for the JASP page with the OSKB &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s still pending as of October 12, but you will be able to find it at this link when they approve it: https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/73379 In discussions with the OSKB today, we are going to put together a few promotional materials to help everyone find the community including a paper for the JASP materials, a presentation at Midwestern Psychological Association, and a twitter poster for the Society of Teaching of Psychology.</description>

      <description>Heyo! Frederik, the author of papaja, requested that we update him with papers written with his package. I was like, oh man, like the whole lab?! So, I decided that I could probably make it easy by making a table here. Obviously, this table is current at the moment, as I hope many of the ones under review will get accepted, and I have several others that we will start writing soon.</description>
